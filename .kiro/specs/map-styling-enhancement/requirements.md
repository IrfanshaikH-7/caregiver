# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Map Styling Enhancement feature aims to improve the visual appearance and consistency of location maps throughout the application. Currently, the map in the LocationMap component is not square and lacks proper border radius styling. This enhancement will ensure maps have a consistent square aspect ratio and rounded corners that match the application's design system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see location maps with a consistent square shape and rounded corners, so that the application has a more polished and cohesive visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a location map is displayed THEN the system SHALL render the map with equal width and height dimensions.
2. WHEN a location map is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply a border radius of 16px to match the application's design system.
3. WHEN a location map is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the map's responsive behavior across different screen sizes.
4. WHEN a location map is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure the map container has proper overflow handling to prevent content from extending beyond the rounded corners.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the map styling to be consistent with the application's design system, so that UI components maintain visual harmony throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the map styling THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS utility classes where possible to maintain consistency with the rest of the application.
2. WHEN implementing the map styling THEN the system SHALL ensure the styling is applied consistently across all instances of the LocationMap component.
3. WHEN implementing the map styling THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing functionality of the map component.
